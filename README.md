# Getting Started with Create React App

In this project I'm using Tailwind CSS as my CSS framework and Bootstrap to handle some components.

So, once you download this repo run:

### `npm install` or `npm i`

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
